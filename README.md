# Graphical Solution for Linear Programming

![Graphical Solution Interface](https://github.com/mmdeeb/GraphicalSolution/blob/master/Screenshot%202022-12-16%20140954.jpg)

## Overview
Graphical Solution for Linear Programming is an intuitive application designed to solve optimization problems using the graphical method. The program allows users to input linear constraints and an objective function, and then visually find the optimal solution by rendering the feasible region and objective function on a graph. It is programmed in C# Windows Forms, offering a simple yet powerful interface for educational or professional use.

## Features
- Intuitive input for objective functions and linear constraints.
- Option to maximize or minimize the objective function.
- Interactive graph that plots constraints and highlights the feasible region.
- Functionality to add or remove constraints dynamically.
- Real-time solution finding with coordinates and objective function value display.
- Zoom in and out for detailed analysis of the graph.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Compile and execute the application.

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework compatible with Windows Forms
- Visual Studio for compiling the source code

## Usage
1. Start the application.
2. Enter the coefficients of your objective function.
3. Choose whether you want to maximize or minimize the function.
4. Input the coefficients of your linear constraints.
5. Click 'Add Constraint' to plot each constraint on the graph.
6. Once all constraints are added, click 'Find solution' to display the feasible region and optimal value.
7. Use the zoom function to closely inspect the solution space.
